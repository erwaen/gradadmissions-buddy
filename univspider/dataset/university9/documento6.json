Community Engagement The Basics Where is Stanford? Silicon Valley Located 35 miles south of San Francisco and 20 miles north of San Jose, Stanford University is in the heart of Northern Californiaâs dynamic \"Silicon Valley,â home to Yahoo!, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and many other cutting-edge companies that were started by and continue to be led by Stanford alumni and faculty. The Bay Area To the west of the Universityâs 8,180-acre campus are the Santa Cruz Mountains and Pacific Ocean, and to the east San Francisco Bay.  Known as The Peninsula , the area is rich in natural beauty, culture, and entertainment. Palo Alto Although the University is virtually a community unto itself and even has its own zip codeâ94305âit calls the City of Palo Alto home. Downtown Palo Alto is a short walk from campus and includes many attractions, as well as many shops and restaurants.
