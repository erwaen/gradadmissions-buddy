Join us to learn about your own values, how motivation works, and different types of motivation.

As simple as motivation is, you need to be prepared that graduate study is not a sprint, but a marathon. [Concurrent Session A1] Planning a Large Writing Project Michelle Cox, Ph.D. Dr. Michelle Cox has led programs for faculty and student writers and currently directs Cornell’s English Language Support Office.
